## About this repository

Github page with supplementary information to the paper `Entity-aware Transformers for Entity Search' by Emma Gerritse, Faegheh Hasibi and Arjen de Vries, which was accepted at SIGIR 2022, and can be accessed [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00820)

## Structure 
Structure of this github repository is as follows:
In the Runs Directory, you can find all runs in the paper, with the same name as in the paper table 2. 

In the Code directory, all code is available. All models and supplementary materials can be downloaded by running

```
cd Code/make.sh
```

Note that this will download around 40 gb of data.

We recommend running this code in an virtual environment using Python 3.7 (Using newer versions leads to conflicts with Pytorch), for example by using:

```
python3.7 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

All Python packages can be downloaded with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Reranking

To rerank, call the following function in `Code`:

```
python -m pygaggle.run.evaluate_passage_ranker  --split dev --method seq_class_transformer --model pathtomodel --dataset pathtodata --index-dir pathtoindex  --task msmarco --output-file pathtooutput --w2v pathtowikipedia2vec --mapper path2mapper
```

For example:

```
python -m pygaggle.run.evaluate_passage_ranker  --split dev --method seq_class_transformer --model ../output/monobert-large-msmarco-finetuned_acc_batch_testmodel_acc_batch_600k_64_e6 --dataset ../data/DBpedia-Entity  --index-dir ../indexes/lucene-index-dbpedia_annotated_full  --task msmarco --output-file ../runs/testrun.tsv --w2v ../resources/wikipedia2vec/wikipedia-20190701/wikipedia2vec_500.pkl --mapper ../mappers/wikipedia2vec-500-cased.monobert-base-cased.linear.npy
```


## More information 

Most of the code is based on either the [E-BERT](https://github.com/NPoe/ebert) or the [Pygaggle](https://github.com/castorini/pygaggle) repository.

To use on your own datasets, make sure to provide all documents and queries as in the pygaggle repository, but annotate the documents before the index and the queries. Annotations should come right after the mention, for example `Neil Gaiman ENTITY/Neil_Gaiman novels`. We used [REL](https://github.com/informagi/REL), but you can use entity linker as long as the part after the `ENTITY` preamble is a Wikipediapage.

An example of finetuning can be found in `Code/retraining_dbpedia_entity_folds.py`.
